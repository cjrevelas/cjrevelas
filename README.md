My name is Constantinos J. Revelas. Welcome to my GitHub webpage. ðŸ‘‹

# Personal Info
I am a Doctor of Chemical Engineering and Computational Materials Science. I am also a software Engineer by training and\
enthusiast of high permormance computing, scientific computing and investigation of algorithm complexity.

I am proficient and mostly write code in:
