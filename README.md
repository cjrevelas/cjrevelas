My name is Constantinos J. Revelas. Welcome to my GitHub webpage. ðŸ‘‹

I am a Chemical Engineer and finishing PhD student in Computational Materials Science.
I am currently affiliated in the School of Chemical Engineering of the National Techical University of Athens.
If interested, you can have a quick look at the website of my group, directed by Prof. Doros N. Theodorou: [CoMSE](https://comse.chemeng.ntua.gr/)

My research interests include:\
Computational Polymer Physics\
Design of Nanocomposite Materials\
Investigation of Thermodynamic Properties of Polymer Grafted Nanoparticles (PGNs)\
High Performance Computing\
Numerical Analysis
