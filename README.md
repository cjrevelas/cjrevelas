My name is Constantinos J. Revelas. Welcome to my GitHub webpage. ðŸ‘‹

# Personal Info
I am a Chemical Engineer and finishing PhD student in the field of Computational Materials Science.
I am currently affiliated in the School of Chemical Engineering of the National Techical University of Athens.
If interested, you can have a quick look at the website of my group, directed by Prof. Doros N. Theodorou: [CoMSE](https://comse.chemeng.ntua.gr/)

I am also a software Engineer by training and enthusiast of high permormance computing, scientific computing and investigation of
algorithm complexity.

I am proficient and mostly write code in:
