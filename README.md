My name is Constantinos J. Revelas. Welcome to my GitHub webpage. ðŸ‘‹

# Personal Info
I am an experienced C/C++ Software Engineer with a strong background in scientific and high-performance computing.

Currently, I am trained to develop low-level software for operating systems at Teracloud Greece Ltd., where my team\
will be responsible for the modernization of the OpenVMS operating system.

I hold a PhD in Computational Materials Science and Simulations from National Technical University of Athens. My research\
was focused on the development (from scratch) of an in-house 3D finite-element code with a lot of potential for future\
extensions. The code is used to solve partial differential equations in 3D domains for the investigation of thermodynamic\
properties of polymer/solid interfaces.

I also hold a Master of Engineering diploma in Chemical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens,\
where I managed to graduate with the second highest graduate score (9.54/10.0). 

I am proficient and mostly write code in:

In terms of parallel programming I use the **MPI (Message-Passing Interface)** protocol for my own project and I also have some basic knowledge of **CUDA**, which I plan to extend in the future!
